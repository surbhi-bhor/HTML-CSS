           <h3>Immortals of Meluha</h3>
        <p>It is set in 1900 BC, in what the modern Indians mistakenly call the Indus Valley Civilisation. The inhabitants of that period called it the land of Meluha – a near perfect empire created many centuries earlier by Lord Ram, one of the greatest monarchs that ever lived.
            The once proud empire and its Suryavanshi rulers face severe perils as its primary river, the revered Saraswati, is slowly drying to extinction. They also face devastating terrorist attacks from the east, the land of the Chandravanshis.
            To make matters worse, the Chandravanshis appear to have allied with the Nagas, an ostracised and sinister race of deformed humans with astonishing martial skills.
            The only hope for the Suryavanshis is an ancient legend – ‘when evil reaches epic proportions, when all seems lost, when it appears that your enemies have triumphed, a hero will emerge’.
            Is the rough-hewn Tibetan immigrant Shiva, really that hero?</p>

           <h3>The Secret of Nagas</h3>
           <p>Today, he is a God. 4,000 years ago, he was just a Man.
             The Secret of the Nagas is the second book of the Shiva Trilogy, the sequel to the No 1 national bestseller, The Immortals of Meluha.
             Shiva’s hunt for the Naga who killed his friend Brahaspati and targeted his wife Sati, takes him down India’s major river networks, searching for traitors and seeking allies in his war against evil. But evil is rising again, more potent than ever. A whole nation is dying. Another, suffering for no fault of its own. Everyone is suspect: new friends, old allies and even his philosopher guides. At every corner, Shiva finds evidence of Naga activity. A crown prince is murdered. A people held to ransom for a miracle drug made only by the Nagas.
             Shiva’s journey takes him across the length and breadth of Swadweep, to the land of the Brangas and further south, deep into the Dandak forest. Shiva searches for the truth in a land of deadly mysteries – only to find that nothing is what it seems.
             Book 2 of the Shiva trilogy takes up from the point where Shiva is dashing to save Sati at the end of The Immortals of Meluha. Does he succeed? His archenemy seems to be winning every encounter. All Shiva knows for sure is that the Chandravanshis aren’t evil. But then, neither are the Suryavanshis. So who or what is evil? And who is the mysterious Naga that stalks his family? What does he want? What is The Secret of the Nagas?</p>

           <h3>Oath of Vayaputras</h3>
           <p>Evil has risen.Only a God can stop it.        
             Shiva is gathering his forces. He reaches the Naga capital, Panchavati and Evil is finally revealed. The Neelkanth prepares for a holy war against his true enemy, a man whose name instills dread in the fiercest of warriors.
             India convulses under the onslaught of a series of brutal battles. It’s a war for the very soul of the nation. Many will die. But Shiva must not fail, no matter what the cost. In his desperation, he reaches out to the ones who have never offered any help to him: the Vayuputras.
             Will he succeed? And what will be the real cost of battling Evil? To India? And to Shiva’s soul?
            Discover the answer to these mysteries in this concluding part of the bestselling Shiva Trilogy.</p>

        <h3>Scion of Ishvaku</h3>
     <p>Ram Rajya. The Perfect Land. But perfection has a price. He paid that price.
        3400 BCE. INDIA. Ayodhya is weakened by divisions. A terrible war has taken its toll. The damage runs deep. The demon King of Lanka, Raavan, does not impose his rule on the defeated. He, instead, imposes his trade. Money is sucked out of the empire. The Sapt Sindhu people descend into poverty, despondency and corruption. They cry for a leader to lead them out of the morass. Little do they appreciate that the leader is among them. One whom they know. A tortured and ostracised prince. A prince they tried to break. A prince called Ram.
        He loves his country, even when his countrymen torment him. He stands alone for the law. His band of brothers, his wife Sita, and he, against the darkness of chaos.</p>

    <div class="part-2">
        <h3>Sita Warrior of Mithila</h3>
        <p>India, 3400 BCE.
           India is beset with divisions, resentment and poverty. The people hate their rulers. They despise their corrupt and selfish elite. Chaos is just one spark away. Outsiders exploit these divisions. Raavan, the demon king of Lanka, grows increasingly powerful, sinking his fangs deeper into the hapless Sapt Sindhu.
           Two powerful tribes, the protectors of the divine land of India, decide that enough is enough. A saviour is needed. They begin their search.
           An abandoned baby is found in a field. Protected by a vulture from a pack of murderous wolves. She is adopted by the ruler of Mithila, a powerless kingdom, ignored by all. Nobody believes this child will amount to much. But they are wrong.</p>

        <h3>Raavan Enemy of Aryavarta</h3>
        <p>WITHOUT THE DARKNESS, LIGHT HAS NO PURPOSE.
           WITHOUT THE VILLAIN, WHAT WOULD THE GODS DO?
           INDIA, 3400 BCE.
           A land in tumult, poverty, and chaos. Most people suffer quietly. A few rebel. Some fight for a better world. Some for themselves. Some don’t give a damn. Raavan. Fathered by one of the most illustrious sages of the time. Blessed by the Gods with talents beyond all. Cursed by fate to be tested to the extremes.
           A formidable teenage pirate, he is filled with equal parts courage, cruelty, and fearsome resolve. A resolve to be a giant among men, to conquer, plunder, and seize the greatness that he thinks is his right.
           A man of contrasts, of brutal violence and scholarly knowledge. A man who will love without reward and kill without remorse.
           This exhilarating third book of the Ram Chandra series sheds light on Raavan, the king of Lanka. And the light shines on the darkness of the darkest kind. Is he the greatest villain in history or just a man in a dark place, all the time?
           Read the epic tale of one of the most complex, violent, passionate, and accomplished men of all time.
