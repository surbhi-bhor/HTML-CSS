     <h2>“The world would be a nicer place if everyone had the ability to love as unconditionally as a dog.” ― M.K. Clinton</h2>  
     <p>To put it simply, dogs are awesome. Whether they’re begging for your food,
        barking at their leash to convince you to take them on a walk, or simply
        greeting you when you get home, dogs do all of the little things that put
        smiles on faces around the world. What are some of the more endearing reasons 
        why dogs are and always will be man’s best friend?.Based on the tone of your voice
        and your body language, your dog will do its darnedest to emulate your current state
        of mind. When you’re sad, they’ll look at you with big doe eyes. When your angry, the fur 
        will rise on their backs and they’ll start barking and growling at inanimate objects. Whereas 
        humans might not respond to your emotional upswings and downswings in a way that you’d prefer, dogs 
        will always be there whether you’re thrilled, depressed, or anywhere in between.</p>

    <h2>“Dogs are not our whole life, but they make our lives whole.”— Roger Caras</h2>  
    <p>The Labrador Retriever is America’s favorite dog, topping the most popular breeds list for
       a whopping 28 years in a row, and it’s easy to see why. These easygoing, affectionate, energetic
       dogs are family-friendly all-rounders, equally at home on the couch or in the field.Their thick 
       tail (sometimes called an “otter tail”) is used as a powerful rudder, their webbed feet help
       them swim fast, and their thick, waterproof coats keep them happy even in cold water, like the 
       icy Newfoundland waters where they were first bred.Thanks to their intelligence, eagerness to 
       please, and willingness to work hard, Labradors are invaluable workers in a variety of fields.
       They’re the among the most popular choices for service dog work, as well as search and rescue,
       bomb and drug detection, and therapy dog work.</p>

    yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers.

    them highly capable working dogs. Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, 
    sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. They’re also natural 
    athletes and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience. Part of the sporting dog group,
    golden retrievers are active dogs that require at least an hour of daily exercise. They live up to their name;

    companionable, making them great family dogs.The Beagle is an intelligent pack dog who loves the 
    company of other dogs and people.In fact, it was bred to work in packs, so they are happiest when

    companionable—all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the
